Thanks for applying to Red’s Paper Company! Our goal is to provide top-notch service to our loyal customers.

As the new hire, your job is to deliver newspapers. Conveniently, all of our customers can be identified by the red parts of their buildings so be sure not to deliver any newspapers to blue buildings and please avoid breaking anyone’s windows!

Most importantly, have fun!


## DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
* The game was developed using [Unity](https://unity.com) (Unity Engine 2021.3.21f1)
* Most of the game’s 3D models are either pre-built shapes in Unity, or hand-created by myself using the program [Kenney Shape](https://kenney.nl/tools/kenney-shape).
* In the settings, there are images of a space bar, an A key, and a D key which I hand-drew using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org).
