For some of the code, it looks like an Object or primitive data instance is created within a class but the code does not indicate anything being assigned any actual data.

For example, in the GameData class, some variables have default values while variables like carSpawnChance has nothing assigned to it. Within the Unity editor, I am able to directly access the instance of the GameData class in a level which means most of these default values get overwritten directly in the engine but these changes aren't visible if you just look at it via the code alone.
